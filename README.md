    Progression at Christex Foundation
</h1>

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Progression at Christex Foundation repository

This is where all of Christex Foundation's progression frameworks live ðŸ’ª

> Forked from Monzo's progression framework

**Get stuck? There's a glossary at the bottom of this readme!**

**The `frameworks` folder is what you want to pay attention to!**

This is where all of our progression frameworks live. Head inside, and you'll see folders associated to headlines (like design and engineering).

Inside these folders, you'll see files representing a job (like `designer.md`).
